# SACO LED Matrix
I salvaged a LED Matrix using an arduino.

Check out the page on my website.

One day while exploring my local Science and Surplus store, I came across a 16x12 RGB LED Matrix. I though neat I could make something cool from this using one of my microcontrollers. The board was very cheap compared to LED Matrices I had seen online and I had been wanting to work with more LED matrices. I decided then and there to restore this old board into some sort of art piece for my room. 

I found the manufacturer and board name and set to work to research the pin out and any other information I could find on the board. I spent a entire week changing keywords and came up with nothing. The board was made by SACO Technologies Inc. who make large light displays for concerts, architecture, performances, etc. so their product designs were not publically available to my knowledge. I felt very defeated and though I had wasted $15. As a last ditch effort, I posted a message in a DIY electronics online community on Facebook, asking for anyone's input on research or direct help. 

I was so happy to wake up the next morning to 5 responses to my post. Most gave general information I had already gathered like what pins were power and what were data. But 1 article had found a person's personal portfolio. This portfolio had a page where the author had done just what I was trying to do! I was able to get a start on understanding what was going on with the board, actually getting some pins to light up and change colors, but I didn't have real refined control over the board. I also had to learn to deal with interference from my body which I had never experience before. I then had to move so I was forced to pack up everything I had been working on.

Once I was settled into my new place I got back to work on this project. I designed a 3D mount for the board that would also hold an arduino and a 5v power supply. I rewired the whole thing and was not pleased to find my code was no longer working as it did in the video. I kept working on it off and on for about a week until I decided to seek some more help. This time I directly messaged the author of the personal portfolio explaining my situation and the extra information I was seeking to finish this project. This man was such a legend! He replied within 24 hours with a long friendly email that included beautiful diagrams and more than all the information I had asked for. I was so ecstatic. I had been saved, I worked for to days and was easily able to get the system up and running and am now able to precisely control each LED.
